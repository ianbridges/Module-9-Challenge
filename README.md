# Readme Generator, Module-9-Challenge

    In this assignment I created a readme generator
    using my javascript skills. This application allows
    the user to quickly and effortlessly create a
    professional readme. Once the code is opened in a
    terminal and the user types, "node index.js", the
    user will be prompted with questions to help build
    their readme.
